> Resources for orchestrating Earthly with Github Actions

Omashu is a small framework which provides tools for improving the experience
working with Earthly and Github Actions, especially for mono-repos. It provides
a small CLI for auto-discovering `Earthfile`s and various Github Actions which
wrap that process and allow building/running dozens of targets in a single
repository.
